# <a id="philosophy"></a>Teaching Philosophy

I teach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning" target="_blank">inquiry-based</a> courses and laboratories and utilize <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1053825917742165" target="_blank">local fieldwork</a> components to connect course content with local and global challenges. When students understand how a course is relevant beyond the classroom, it captures their attention and sparks curiosity for lifelong learning.

I empower students through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning" target="_blank">active learning</a> and nurture their personal interests so they feel motivated to develop and test their own hypotheses. My students directly participate in the scientific method and learn how to answer their own questions.

I emphasize <a href="https://www.aacu.org/value-rubrics" target="_blank">ethical engagement</a> and teamwork with collaborative group activities and projects. Through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning" target="_blank">problem-based learning</a> components, students develop scientific, professional, and interpersonal skills and learn to solve real-world environmental challenges.

I use the [Transparency in Learning and Teaching (TILT)](https://tilthighered.com){:target="_blank"} approach to advance equitable teaching and learning practices, and reduce systemic inequities in higher education.

<p class="my-img-cap">Graduation ceremony with the monks of Gaden Monastery in Mundgod, Karnataka, India (2015).</p>

During my Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Biology at <a href="https://www.emory.edu" target="_blank">Emory University</a>, I had the extraordinary opportunity to teach a summer course (Intro to Biology) with the <a href="https://tibet.emory.edu" target="_blank">Emory-Tibet Science Initiative (ETSI)</a>. ETSI was the formal integration of science education at Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and nunneries in India. It represented the most significant change in 600 years for the traditional Tibetan Buddhist monastic curriculum. I co-taught biology at Gaden Monastery in India.

Stay tuned for a **forthcoming paper** in _Frontiers in Communication_ on how being an ETSI faculty member informed my teaching philosophy.
