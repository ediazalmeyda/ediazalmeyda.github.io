# <a id="overview"></a>Research Overview: Microbial Ecology of Mutualisms

As an Assistant Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies at [New College of Florida](https://www.ncf.edu){:target="_blank"}, my lab explores how mutualisms respond and adapt to anthropogenic stressors in marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

Our aims include:
1. Understanding threats to host-associated microbial biodiversity, an essential component to healthy ecosystems.
2. Exploring how host-microbe interactions can adapt to anthropogenic stressors.
3. Partnering with community stakeholders to support microbial health in land and water management.

We utilize experimental biology (host-symbiont physiology, genomics, and experimental evolution) and fieldwork approaches to study mutualisms in **coral reef ecosystems**, **agroecological systems** ([Milpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milpa){:target="_blank"}, an ancient agricultural method from Mesoamerica; urban food forests; and host-microbe interactions in agricultural pests), and **coupled human-environment systems** (coastlines; coastal rivers; managed ranches; archaeological sites; and sustainable landscape design).

New College is a public liberal arts honors college, and my lab incorporates undergraduates in all aspects of research, from hypothesis to publication. My lab also collaborates in interdisciplinary research with anthropologists, botanists, geographers, and community stakeholders.

# <a id="coral"></a>Symbiosis in coral reef ecosystems

Coral reefs are at risk to become the first ecosystem to collapse as a consequence of climate change. My research aims to understand how coral reef symbiosis is disrupted by anthropogenic stressors, and to explore the mechanisms of acclimation to a warming ocean.

Coral reefs are built by colonies of coral polyps, small marine invertebrates (cnidarians, like jellyfish and sea anemone). In a symbiotic relationship, corals (the host) provide Symbiodiniaceae (the symbiont; a photosynthetic algae) with a home and a supply of inorganic molecules, while the algae provide corals with nutrient byproducts from photosynthesis. Increases in ocean temperature, driven by climate change, prompts the algal symbiont to leave the coral host when temperatures become inhospitable. Disrupting this symbiotic relationship can ultimately lead to coral bleaching, or worse, massive coral die-offs.

My lab uses experimental biology (host-symbiont physiology, genomics, and experimental evolution) and fieldwork approaches to investigate the mechanisms of thermotolerance in coral-algal symbiosis.

Our broader goals are to understand how to mitigate stress and prevent bleaching events, and to help inform coral restoration efforts in the field.

### Thermotolerance of Symbiodiniaceae

My lab explores the thermal limits of different species of Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates using physiological measurements in experimental settings. Symbiodiniaceae are physiologically diverse with variance in thermotolerance and thermosensitivity. In other words, thermotolerance is not a phylogenetically conserved trait. My lab is also investigating the microbial communities associated with Symbiodiniaceae and their possible roles in thermotolerance.

Coral Reefs, 30(1), 217-225.

### Symbiodiniaceae genomics

My lab explores the mechanisms driving temperature acclimation and adaptation in coral-algal symbiosis. To answer these questions, we challenge _Symbiodinium_ to high water temperatures and analyze their transcriptomic responses at different time points. For _Symbiodinium microadriaticum_, our results show that short-term and long-term stress can trigger different responses. Short-term stress appears to be survivable, while long-term stress is detrimental to the symbiosis and risks permanent damage or death.

In addition to improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind thermotolerance, my lab has contributed to understanding the chronobiology of _Symbiodinium_ through our transcriptomic work. Understanding chronobiology is crucial for explaining the coordination of coral-algal symbiosis.

### Genomics of host-microbe interactions in coral reef ecosystems

Host-microbe interactions are key to understanding the health of coral reef ecosystems. My lab is investigating the mechanisms behind the establishment of coral-algal symbiosis. Using experimental biology, we explore the transcriptomic response of the host to diverse symbionts at different developmental stages. We focus on _Orbicella faveolata_, a crucial reef-building coral that is susceptible to mass bleaching events. Our research shows that the coral host’s transcriptome can be affected in different ways based on: 1) the host’s developmental stage when exposed to the algal symbiont; and 2) the species of algal symbiont.

My lab also uses the upside-down jellyfish _Cassiopea xamachana_ as a model organism to explore questions of host-microbe interactions. _Cassiopea xamachana_ is a cnidarian, like coral, and is also symbiotic with Symbiodiniaceae, but is much easier to grow in laboratory conditions compared with coral. This makes _Cassiopea xamachana_ an excellent model for undergraduate students to learn experimental biology and to design and conduct their own experiments.

# <a id="agro"></a>Host-microbe interactions in agroecology

My lab aims to understand host-microbe interactions that support a variety of sustainable agroecological practices. We are currently investigating the mechanisms underlying the antibiotic disease resistance in soil exposed to Milpa, an ancient agricultural polycrop from Mesoamerica. We are also assessing microbial biodiversity in urban food forests.

Agricultural pests and their microbes are an excellent experimental system to study host-microbe interactions. In collaboration with the [Gerardo Lab](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/gerardolab/){:target="_blank"} at Emory University, we use transcriptomics to understand how the absence of an obligate symbiont impacts the overall health of its host as well as the detailed mechanisms how the insect gut (crypts) harbours microbial symbionts.

Using experimental evolution with squash bugs (_Anasa tristis_) and their horizontally transmitted symbiont (_Burkholderia_) we explore how the mode of transmission of the symbiont affects the fitness of the symbiont and its host.

Our broader goal of this research is to reduce or eliminate pesticide use in managing agricultural pests.

# <a id="env"></a>Microbial biodiversity of coupled human-environment systems

My lab is engaged in longitudinal microbial biodiversity assessments in coupled human-environment systems, including: the [Triangle Ranch Conservation Area](https://www.conservationfoundation.com/triangle-ranch-conservation-area/?back=Properties){:target="_blank"} that surrounds the Myakka River; the sustainable landscape design at the [Florida House Institute](http://floridahouseinstitute.org){:target="_blank"}; beaches in the Florida Keys. Cohorts of undergraduate researchers in my lab are documenting microbial diversity and generating long-term datasets to support community stakeholders and decision-makers involved in water and land management.

My lab is also collaborating with anthropologists, botanists, geographers, and community stakeholders to document changes in biodiversity in fragile ecosystems and archaeological sites that are projected to be affected by climate change and rising sea level in the near-term. My lab is documenting microbes associated with a coastal architecture called [tabby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby_concrete){:target="_blank"} (an 18th to early 20th century architectural material made from oyster shells) at [De Soto National Memorial](https://www.nps.gov/deso/index.htm){:target="_blank"}. Our goal is to inform management practices and contribute to the conservation of coastal heritage.
