# Mutualisms in marine and coastal ecosystems

My lab explores how mutualisms respond and adapt to anthropogenic stressors in marine and coastal ecosystems. Undergraduates are my junior colleagues in my research and teaching. We utilize experimental biology (host-symbiont physiology, genomics, and experimental evolution) and fieldwork approaches to study:
1. Symbiosis in marine invertebrates (coral reefs, jellyfish, and sea anemone).
2. Coastal microbial biodiversity in coupled human-environment systems (beaches, reefs, coastal landscape design).
3. Longitudinal assessments of water quality and microbial biodiversity in coastal rivers and wetlands.

We also engage in interdisciplinary projects with anthropologists, botanists, geographers, and community stakeholders to study:
1. The role of microbial biodiversity in preserving coastal archaeological sites and cultural heritage.
2. Host-microbe interactions in agroecology (Milpa, an ancient agricultural method from Mesoamerica, and food forests).

Our broader aim is to mitigate threats to host-associated microbial biodiversity, an essential aspect of [healthy ecosystems](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.2448){:target="_blank"}.

I advise undergraduate research in my classes and labs, in specialized seminars and independent study programs, and in students’ honors theses. I guide my students to discover their own interests, generate novel questions and hypotheses, write internal grants, collect and analyze data, and communicate and defend their conclusions to their thesis committee.

# Teaching

I use evidence-based pedagogies to foster critical thinking, collaboration, ethical engagement, and inclusivity. Lab and [field experiences](https://doi.org/10.1177/1053825917742165){:target="_blank"} are central to my approach of directly engaging students in the scientific method. I develop student-centered undergraduate biology courses by aligning my teaching with the main elements of the [Vision and Change report (2011)](https://visionandchange.org/resources/){:target="_blank"} from AAAS. I apply the [Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE)](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.14-01-0004){:target="_blank"} approach to teach students how to do original research and take part in larger, multi-student projects.

I use [Transparency in Learning and Teaching (TILT)](https://tilthighered.com){:target="_blank"} to enhance equitable pedagogies and reduce systemic inequities in my classes. Using the [VALUE Rubrics](https://www.aacu.org/value-rubrics){:target="_blank"} from the AAC&U, I create spaces in my class discussions for ethical engagement. I emphasize [mindsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset){:target="_blank"} for growth, sense of belonging, and connection with purpose by using [Writing-To-Learn (WTL)](https://wac.colostate.edu/resources/wac/intro/wtl/){:target="_blank"} activities to integrate class content with students’ reflections. I use [place-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place-based_education){:target="_blank"} and [community-based](https://www.colorado.edu/cuengage/about-us/what-community-based-learning){:target="_blank"} pedagogies to open spaces for individual experiences and culture in education.
