<h1><i class="my-icon-h1"></i>Coastal Microbial Ecology Lab</h1>
<p>Research in my lab investigates how climate change and rising sea temperatures affect marine symbiosis, and how anthropogenic stressors impact coastal microbial diversity. I use the ridge-to-reef framework to account for natural and social systems affecting the coast.</p>
<div class="my-content-img"><img src="assets/img/lab.jpg"><p>My fun and creative junior colleagues!</p></div>
<p>My lab is at a primarily undergraduate institution, and my students are mentored as junior research colleagues. They learn diverse approaches in marine research, including: fieldwork, experimental biology (genomics, host-symbiont physiology, experimental evolution), place- and community-based research inclusive of local stakeholders, collaborating with international teams, interdisciplinary work with social scientists and humanities scholars, and working with Indigenous communities (Mayans in the Yucatán Peninsula). My students co-author manuscripts, present at conferences, and continue research in graduate programs.</p>

<p>Climate change and other anthropogenic stressors threaten symbiosis and microbial diversity, resulting in critical risks to the interdependent health of hosts, microbes, ecosystems, and, ultimately, people and coastal communities. My local and international field sites include: coastal sites near my institution; the Florida Keys; the two major coral reef systems in México—the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System and the Veracruzano Reef System; and the central Mexican Pacific coast.</p>
<p>In fieldwork, I collaborate with researchers at UNAM Puerto Morelos at the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, Universidad Veracruzana at the Veracruzano Reef System, and with MOTE Marine Laboratory in restoration efforts of reef-building corals in the Florida Keys.</p>
